103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

ex:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
