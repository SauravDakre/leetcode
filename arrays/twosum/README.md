Two Sum

https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/92/array/546/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

ex:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
